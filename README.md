This project is intended to serve as the backend of a mapping tool. It was developed in collaboration with https://izever.shinyapps.io/croydon_shopping_tool/.

The work makes use of (Firebase)[https://firebase.google.com/], a Google-backed development platform for apps. In particular it utilises the (Firebase Realtime Database)[https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/] to store data. Using an API key, it is straightforward to allow another tool to pull or push data.

This is an ongoing project and input is welcome.
